    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      In ancient times, Elven smiths crafted the Rings of Power with their
      magical skill. The Dark Lord, Sauron, forged these rings and filled them
      with his own power. Later, despite searching throughout Middle-earth for
      the One Ring, which ruled all the other Rings, he was unable to find it.
